## SBRT Mentorship Project (Spring 2024) 
The SBRT Mentorship aims to provide hands-on learning and development opportunities for aspiring students in the field. The project pairs experienced mentors with motivated mentees to collaborate on a real-world project over the course of a semester. The primary goal is to foster a learning environment where mentees can gain practical skills, insights, and experience through guided mentorship and teamwork.
